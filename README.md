# multi-currency eWallet 
Simple eWallet Dart web application that allows user to convert foreign 
currencies and calculate the total of money in base currency.

The data is stored in local storage.

Foreign exchange rates obtained via [Exchange Rates API](https://exchangeratesapi.io/).

I used [Materialize Framework](https://materializecss.com/) for styling.

Live version can be found [here](https://atarsa.github.io/eWallet-dart/).

## Run application locally
After downloading or cloning repository, go to `pubspec.yaml` file and
 enable Dart SDK for the project. Next, get the dependencies (run `pub get
 ` if necessary). 
 To run the server run `webdev serve` command.
